		 <h3>HTML 5.0 </h3>
		 <p> This is the temporary homepage for <span class = "name"> Shaun Bunch </span>.  It
		 consists of a basic html 5.0 template, along with some html elements, like headers,
		 paragraphs, links, etc.  </p>
		 <p> This page also makes use of both div and span tags, which allow us to create styles
		 for different areas on the page.</p>
		 <h3>CSS 3.0 </h3>
		 <p> We are able to give style to each of the different tags on the page using CSS.  Note that
		 up in the head we've included a link to a stylesheet called "basic.css".  In the file "basic.css",
		 we define the styles for the different tags on this page. </p>
		 <h3>Uploading Everything to a Server </h3>
		 <p> Before the world can see this web page located at
		 <strong>http://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~<span class = "name">sb84772</span>
		 </strong>, you must first upload this index.html web page (plus, assignments.html), the styles
		 associated with this web page (basic.css), and all the images we've included on this web page to
		 the web server's public_html directory.  Once the page and all its associated files are on a web
		 server (as opposed to being on your computer), the rest of the world should be able to see it.
		 <strong>DO NOT SHARE THIS WEBSITE ADDRESS WITH ANY OTHER STUDENT IN CLASS!</strong>  </p>
